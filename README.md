# Weirdo Chat

It is a weirdo chat simulation. If you are polite and starting a conversation with greetings in English, Estonian or Russion, it should respond correspondingly. Otherwise it is going to respond with modified version of your message:

- full sentence revers
- words letters revers (original sentence order)
- encoding with SHA512

A conversation is limited with VITE_MAX_MESSAGES_IN_POOL .env variable
